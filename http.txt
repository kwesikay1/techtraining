HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a foundational protocol used for communication on the World Wide Web. It defines the rules for transmitting and receiving information between web browsers and servers. HTTP operates as a request-response protocol, where a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data or information. It is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent of previous ones. HTTP forms the basis for data communication on the internet, facilitating the transfer of text, images, files, and other resources between clients and servers.
