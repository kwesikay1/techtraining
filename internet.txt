The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate through standardized protocols. It facilitates the exchange of information, resources, and services. Originally developed for military and academic purposes, the Internet has evolved into a vast, decentralized network connecting billions of users worldwide. It enables various online activities such as communication (email, social media), information retrieval (web browsing), and collaborative work. The Internet relies on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) to ensure reliable data transmission. Its impact on communication, commerce, and knowledge dissemination has transformed modern society.
