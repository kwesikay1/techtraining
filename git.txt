Git is a distributed version control system designed for tracking changes in source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds, Git allows multiple developers to collaborate seamlessly on projects. It provides a decentralized structure, enabling each user to have their own complete repository, including the entire project history. Users can commit changes, create branches for parallel development, merge changes, and track versions efficiently. Git is widely used in software development to manage code, facilitate collaboration, and maintain a robust version history.
